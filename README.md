# Muta<sup>*(te)*</sup>

Muta is a pre-alpha project. Beware, thar' be dragons ahead!

## Develop Installation

Muta uses [gpm][gpm] to manage dependencies and locking. Run the following
commands to install.

```shell
gpm install
gpm install Godeps.dev
```

**Develop Note:** In the upcoming Go 1.5, Vendor dependencies will be 
better/fully supported. As a result, this library will be switching to 
that and away from gpm.
